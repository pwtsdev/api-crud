# API CRUD Testing with Playwright

This project demonstrates how to write basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) tests for a REST API using Playwright with TypeScript.
It provides a structured setup to efficiently automate API testing with best practices.
With this setup, you'll have a solid foundation to create fast, reliable, and maintainable API tests, empowering you to deliver high-quality software efficiently.

It includes all necessary configurations and dependencies to get started with automated testing using Playwright and TypeScript, ensuring a seamless setup process and enabling you to focus on writing efficient and robust test cases right from the start.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v20 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pwtsdev/api-crud.git
   cd api-crud
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Dependencies

The project includes the following dependencies:

- `@eslint/js`
- `@faker-js/faker`
- `@playwright/test`
- `@types/node`
- `eslint`
- `eslint-config-prettier`
- `eslint-plugin-playwright`
- `prettier`
- `typescript`
- `typescript-eslint`
- `dotenv`
- `tslog`

## Scripts

The `package.json` file includes several scripts to help you run and manage your tests:

- `pretest`: Runs TypeScript compiler without emitting files and lints the code using ESLint.
- `test`: Runs all Playwright tests.
- `test:headed`: Runs all Playwright tests in headed mode.
- `test:debug`: Runs all Playwright tests in debug mode.
- `test:ui`: Opens the Playwright test runner UI.
- `test:nolint`: Runs all Playwright tests without linting.
- `show-report`: Opens the Playwright test report.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you can use the following commands:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Run all tests:

   ```sh
   npm run test
   ```

3. Run tests in headed mode:

   ```sh
   npm run test:headed
   ```

4. Run tests in debug mode:

   ```sh
   npm run test:debug
   ```

5. Open the Playwright test runner UI:

   ```sh
   npm run test:ui
   ```

6. Run tests without linting:

   ```sh
   npm run test:nolint
   ```

7. Show the Playwright test report:

   ```sh
   npm run show-report
   ```

## Configuration

The project is configured to use Prettier and ESLint for code formatting and linting. The configuration files are located in the `.vscode` directory and the root of the project:

- `settings.json`: Contains VS Code settings for auto-saving, formatting, and linting.
- `extensions.json`: Recommends extensions for VS Code.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
- `.prettierignore`: Files and directories to ignore for Prettier.
- `.gitignore`: Files and directories to ignore for Git.

## Fun Facts

Did you know? APIs are like waiters in a restaurant ‚Äì you place an order (send a request), and they bring you food (response). But sometimes, they get confused and bring you the wrong dish (unexpected data), forget your order (timeout), or just ghost you completely (server down). üçΩÔ∏èü§ñüòÇ
