### # M03L11 - PRACTICE

## PART I - FETCH COURSES

Use the API endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/courses` to perform the following tests:

1. **Retrieve all courses**:
   - Send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/courses`.
   - Verify that the response contains at least one course.
2. **Retrieve a single course**:

   - Send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/courses/txxg`.
   - Verify that the response matches the expected format:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "txxg",
     "title": "Python Data Analysis",
     "instructorId": "qdk1",
     "duration": "10 weeks",
     "category": "Data Science",
     "description": "Learn data analysis using Python and Pandas."
   }
   ```

## PART II - CREATE A NEW COURSE

Use the API endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/courses` to create a new course.

1. **Send a `POST` request**:

   - Use the following JSON payload:

   ```json
   {
     "title": "JavaScript for Beginners",
     "instructorId": "abc123",
     "duration": "8 weeks",
     "category": "Web Development",
     "description": "An introductory course on JavaScript programming."
   }
   ```

2. **Validate the response**:
   - Ensure that the response status code is `201 Created`.
   - Verify that the response body contains the newly created course with an assigned `id`.
